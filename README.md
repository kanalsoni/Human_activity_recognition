# Human_activity_recognition
This project tends to classify the activities that humans carry out on a regular basis by the help of Machine Learning. Here, four ML algorithms are being used that are Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, KNN, and Random Forest. Amongst all, Logistic Regression aces the model with the maximum accuracy of 95 percent.
